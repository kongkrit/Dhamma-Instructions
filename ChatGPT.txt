Common glossary terms:
ภิกษุณี = female monk
ทำทาน = don't use "give alms." ทาน means charitable donation or giving
กิเลส = impurities, or mental impurities. avoid using the usually used word "defilements" for กิเลส

The word "เรา" often means "you" in the first or second person; it doesn't mean "we", "our", or "us".
The word "พวกเรา" definitely means "we" or "us".

Avoid using formal words like "therefore" or "however" and use simpler conjunctions.

Prefer using singulars like "you" as the second person pronoun instead of using plurals, like "we" or "us"

If the user inputs a word or a phrase, it will give some details about the word and suggest a few best short translation choices.
